## Project 1: EXCEL FUNCTIONS

### Project Overview

Excel functions are powerful tools that simplify data analysis and calculations, making work easier and more efficient. This project dives into essential functions (NOT ALL), showing practical examples and real-life applications to help users build confidence and proficiency in handling various data tasks and decision-making.

## Excel functions
Excel functions are categorized based on their purpose and usage. Here is a breakdown of various types of Excel functions and their purposes:

### 1. Mathematical & Trigonometric Functions
   - **SUM**: Adds values in a range of cells.
   - **AVERAGE**: Calculates the mean of values in a range.
   - **ROUND**: Rounds a number to a specified number of digits.
   - **INT**: Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.
   - **MOD**: Returns the remainder after dividing two numbers.
   - **SIN, COS, TAN**: Calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle.

### 2. Logical Functions
   - **IF**: Checks whether a condition is met and returns one value if true, and another if false.
   - **AND**: Returns TRUE if all conditions are true, otherwise FALSE.
   - **OR**: Returns TRUE if any of the conditions are true.
   - **NOT**: Reverses the logic of its argument, returning FALSE for TRUE and vice versa.
   - **IFERROR**: Returns a specified value if an error is found in a formula.

### 3. Text Functions
   - **CONCATENATE** / **CONCAT** / **Textjoin**: Combines multiple strings into one.
   - **LEFT, RIGHT, MID, FIND, SEARCH**: Extracts characters from a string based on position.
   - **UPPER, LOWER, PROPER**: Converts text to uppercase, lowercase or proper case.
   - **LEN**: Returns the number of characters in a string.
   - **TRIM**: Removes extra spaces from a string, leaving single spaces between words.

### 4. Volatile Functions: 
   Functions that occur anytime a change is made on the workbook,    
   - **RAND** / **RANDBETWEEN**: Generates random numbers.

### 5. Lookup & Reference Functions
   - **VLOOKUP**: Searches for a value in the first column of a range and returns a value in the same row from another column.
   - **HLOOKUP**: Similar to VLOOKUP but searches across the top row.
   - **INDEX**: Returns the value of a cell at the intersection of a row and column.
   - **MATCH**: Searches for a specified value in a range and returns its position.
   - **XLOOKUP**: An improved version of VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP, offering more flexibility.

### 6. Statistical Functions
   - **COUNT**: Counts the number of cells containing numbers in a range.
   - **COUNTA**: Counts the number of non-empty cells in a range.
   - **MIN, MAX**: Returns the smallest or largest value in a range.
   - **MEDIAN**: Finds the median value in a range.
   - **STDEV**: Calculates the standard deviation of a set of values.

#### OTHER FUNCTIONS DISCOVERED:

### 1. Date & Time Functions
   - **TODAY**: Returns the current date.
   - **NOW**: Returns the current date and time.
   - **DATE**: Creates a date from year, month, and day values.
   - **YEAR, MONTH, DAY**: Extracts the year, month, or day from a date.
   - **DATEDIF**: Calculates the difference between two dates in days, months, or years.

### 2. Array Functions
